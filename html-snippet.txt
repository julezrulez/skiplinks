Put the following code before the first link in the body of your html.

<a href="#content" class="visually-hidden">Skip to content</a>

Any cookie message should be prior to the skiplink shown.

Put some id's in the right place in your code to skip to, i.e.:

<div id="content">
</div>


Or use:

<a name="content"></a>



Please note some browsers have (or had) trouble skipping to a non-focusable element.
A work-around is tabindex="-1":

<div id="menu" tabindex="-1">
